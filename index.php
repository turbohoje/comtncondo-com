	      <h1>Colorado Mountain Condo</h1>
	      <p>Keystone, Arapahoe Basin, Brekenridge, Copper Mountain, Vail, and Beaver Creek are all nearby.  The picture above was taken 2010-10-15 from the east-facing balcony of the place.

	      <p>If someone were to ask me "what do you love most about your home?" my answer would be: Its proximity to endless hours of fun and adventure, with our stunning view coming in at a close second!
		  <p>The summit condo is a cozy retreat for my fiance and I to get away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. It allows us to take in all of the beauty that the Rocky Mountains have to offer, and serves as a jumping off point for all of our outdoor activities. It is perfect for a weekend getaway or a long stay, and sleeps two couples comfortably (with a third couple via sleeper sofa). </p>
